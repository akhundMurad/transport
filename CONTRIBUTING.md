# Contributing

This page discribes how to contribute to Transport.

## Requirements

- supported Python version (e.g. Python 3.10 or Python 3.11).
- Redis, since we have integration and end-to-end tests.

2. clone the forked repository

## Formatters

We are using the following linters:

- black
- flake8
- mypy
- isort

`Makefile` supports a task to run linters:

```bash
make check-linting
```

## How to name branches

It doesn't matter, as long as branch names don't contain anything that violates the Code of Conduct included in the project's repository. As a general rule of thumb, branch names should have a descriptive name, or refer the number of an issue in their name.
